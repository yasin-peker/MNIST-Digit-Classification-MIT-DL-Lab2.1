# MNIST-Digit-Classification-MIT-DL-Lab2.1
This project is a part of MIT 6.S191 Introduction to Deep Learning course. In the first portion of this lab, we will build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) for the classification of handwritten digits from the famous MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images. Our classes are the digits 0-9.
